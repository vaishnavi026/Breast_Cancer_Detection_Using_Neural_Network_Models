Deployed the model for Breast Cancer detection. Developed the model using Backpropagation Neural Network and compared the results with Radial Basis Function Network, Support Vector Machine & Decision Tree (implemented in Python)

> Language Used : Python

> Libraries Used : csv,  numpy,  matplotlib, sklearn, pandas, time.

> IDE Used : PyCharm

> Function Prototype:
	Back Propagation: 
	train: 
	parameters: attributes, target class, epochs, learning rate, number of hidden nodes.
	Plots change in error with epochs.
	Predict:
	Parameters: attributes, target class.
	Generates confusion matrix, accuracy.

	Radial Basis Function:
	Parameters: Number of hidden nodes.
	Gives accuracy in Radial Basis Function.
	
	predict_1:
	Parameters: Attributes
	Classifies given input as malignant or benign
